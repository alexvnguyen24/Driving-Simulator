          <section id =”Wireframes”>
            <h2> Wireframes </h2>
            <p>The wireframe for our game has been created to be simple and easy to navigate. On our first page is the title card. The title card has the name of the game, 
                a button that accesses the instructions page, and a button to start the game. Upon starting the game, the user is presented with a screen where they input their 
                name. Then, they are given multiple levels to choose to play from. However, it's mandatory that the user completes the levels in chronological order. Then as the 
                game progresses, the user goes through the different levels and learns countless invaluable lessons about the road and how to navigate them. They will be faced 
                with different road signs and basic questions about the laws of the road, which they will have to overcome in order to proceed to the next level of the game. 
                The user is provided with 3 lives. If the user answers the question incorrectly on a given level wrong three times, they will lose the game and the screen turns
                into a GAME OVER screen. If the user successfully answers all of the questions with lives left to spare, then they move on to the next level, and if they reach 
                the end of all levels, then they see a YOU WON screen.
